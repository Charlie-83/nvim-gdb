# MinGW support
- Git rid of the custom frame format in lldb (test_70_quickfix)
- Detect whether the debugged process is running using side channel: prompt -> paused, query on output feed timeout (test_interrupt, test_command)
- Asynchronous querying of breakpoints and commands (no wait)
- handle <up arrow> in pywinpty PDB
- debug logging from gdb and lldb
- Press any key to exit: need to unblock msvcrt.getch() somehow
- cmake test in win32?
- Visual tests: attach('tcp', address=...)
- pty resizing with neovim
- Port cmake completion to lua, extend it to suggest shell commands

Store and load breakpoints between sessions
