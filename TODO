- Cleanup error: permission denied (the directory in use)
- Unexpected excessive gdb prompt causing query-breakpoint loop (debounce)
- `info breakpoints` may result in file path split in the middle
- pty resizing with neovim
- Unicode must be enabled globall for now: `chcp 65001` doesn't help per session
- Press any key to exit: need to unblock msvcrt.getch() somehow
- cmake test in win32?

Store and load breakpoints between sessions
