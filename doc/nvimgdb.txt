Section 1: Usage                                                *NvimgdbUsage*

This plugin will facilitate debugging programs with GDB or LLDB. It will
automatically show debugged source code, breakpoints, and define convenient
keymaps similar to Qt Creator and Microsoft Visual Studio.

To start debugging, execute `:GdbStart` command with GDB launch string as
parameter: >

    :GdbStart gdb -q -f a.out

or alternatively `:GdbStartLLDB` with LLDB launch string as parameter: >

    :GdbStartLLDB lldb a.out

This will open a new tab with debugging view: horizontal split with source
code and terminal. Then the whole set of commands will be available.

NOTE: Ensure the flag `-f` is passed to GDB for proper integration. Without it,
      source code wouldn't be displayed in neovim window.

The plugin performs configuration on the first stop of the debugger. If you
launch by attaching to already running program, the first stop won't open the
source code location of the frame. To catch up, just navigate around the call
stack with `:GdbFrameUp` and `:GdbFrameDown`.

Section 3: Mappings                                          *NvimgdbMappings*

The following mappings are defined initially:

<leader>dd             Fill in command to start debugging with GDB, you will
                       still need to enter <cr> to execute it.

<leader>dl             Fill in command to start debugging with LLDB, you will
                       still need to enter <cr> to execute it.

When debugging session has started, the following mappings are defined:

<f5>                   Continue                       (`:GdbContinue`)
<f10>                  Next                           (`:GdbNext`)
<f11>                  Step                           (`:GdbStep`)
<f12>                  Finish                         (`:GdbFinish`)
<f8>                   Toggle breakpoint              (`:GdbToggleBreakpoint`)
<c-p>                  Frame Up                       (`:GdbFrameUp`)
<c-n>                  Frame Down                     (`:GdbFrameDown`)
<f9>                   NORMAL: Evaluate word under cursor (`:GdbEvalWord`)
                       VISUAL: Evaluate the range         (`:GdbEvalRange`)
